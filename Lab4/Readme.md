# Multi-Region Deployment with Load Balancing
## Solution Overview
The lift-and-shift migrating strategy for a web application that is now running on two virtualized machines—WebServerVM and SQLVM—is explained in this High-Level Design (HLD) paper. In the cloud environment, achieving load balancing and high accessibility across several locations is the aim. In order to assure continuous service access, the application's architecture is built to handle programmed redundancy and limited downtime (no longer than six hours).

## Target architecture Description
### Components
#### WebServerVM:
- **Function**:Hosts fixed material and functions like the frontend server.
- **Replication**:To guarantee high availability, replicas are set up in a minimum of two separate places.
- **Load Balancing**:A global load-balancing device can be utilized to divide traffic that arrives among regional instances.

#### SQLVM:
- **Role**:Serves as the backend for holding information from applications by hosting the SQL database
- **Replication**:Among regions, information replication is configured.
- **Failover**: In the instance of a regional failure, automated failover procedures are setup for transferring to a backup database in another region.

### Redundancy and Failover

- **Multi-Region Deployment**:Both WebServerVM and SQLVM have been replicated in various locations to guard toward regional failures and to decrease performance through serving customers within the local data center.
- **Load Balancers**: By allocating client requests according to the location, global load balancers optimize the speed of response and divide the load within servers.
- **Database Failover**:ensures that an additional database in an alternate locale may take over in the case of a main database loss without affecting application availability by using SQL reflecting or continuous reliability groups, based according to the SQL version.


## Migration Steps

### Replication of Virtual Machines:
- In the desired areas, build identical WebServerVM and SQLVM virtual machines.
- To keep things identical make sure the virtual machines are set up with comparable networking and safety configurations.
### Configuration of Load Balancers:
-Install global load balancers to control the distribution of traffic among various locations.
- Set up health monitoring to keep an eye on virtual machine examples' stability and divert traffic from any machines which are not functioning..
### Implementation of Database Replication and Failover:
-Set up replication of information through the primary and secondary SQLVM servers in different places in the world.
-In order to ensure that the second database taking control with a small amount of disturbance in the event when the primary database fails, configure automated failover rules.
## Conclusion
The application will keep continuing to be extremely accessible and resistant to region disturbances thanks to this migration method. The program is in an excellent spot to fulfill its uptime demands and offer a dependable user interface through applying multi-region installations and advanced failover methods.
