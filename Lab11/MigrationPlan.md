## MigrationPlan.md
## 1. Discovery and Tooling Setup 
- **Tools for Discovery:** Tailwind OpenCare could use Azure Migrate, an agentless appliance, that can efficiently discover existing hardware without the need of setting up software on every computer.

- **Information to Gather:**
  - Inventory of all running software and systems.
  - Statistics of the server's infrastructure (CPU, RAM, disk use).
  - Connections between software and networks.
  - Measures of efficiency (memory consumption, disk IO, CPU occupancy).
  - Databases measurements and trends in development.

- **Credentials oversight:**
  Use the Azure Key Vault to safeguard credentials and permissions, allowing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict exposure and enable restricted access. Secrets which includes login credentials, connection to databases, strings that are SSH keys in order and certifications are safely stored in Azure Key Vault, which encodes them both in transport and at rest. RBAC reduces hazards to security and improves adherence to regulatory standards by ensuring that only those with special permission or services are issued the required authorizations for obtaining these login details.

## 2. Assessment Planning 
- **Assessment Parameters:**
-Duration for the performance history: at least one month.
-Dependent on performance sizing approach with a scaling buffer.
-Checks for an appropriate fit of migration.
-Evaluation along with expense estimation.
-Verification of the OS and app compatible.

- **Target Azure Configuration:**
-Canada East (or the closest for compatibility) is the Azure Region.
-Type of Compute: Azure virtual computers (for best performance, use the Standard_DS category)
-The storage Sort: Azure Controlled Disks (Standard SSD for web/backend servers, the premium version SSD for PostgreSQL)
-Setting up the network: Azure Virtualization A network (VNet) with Security Groups (NSGs) along with Subnets
-Azure Rehabilitation Service Vault can be integrated into Azure Backup as a backup as well as recovery solution.

  - **Validation of Assessment Results:**
  Clearly explain each of the evaluation criteria (performance, cost, scaling, reliability, and legality) in joint workshops with stakeholders to verify the evaluation findings. Deliver full reports that include data insights and graphic charts, alongside in-depth discussions of the solutions. Urge those with interest to voice their concerns and promptly resolve any discrepancy that exists. Acquire formal approval before moving on to the following stages.

## 3. Dependency Analysis and Optimization
- **Dependency Mapping:** To create a thorough view of server interdependencies while impacting active demands, deploy Azure Migrate's agentless dependency mapping service.

- **Cleaning Dependency Data:** you can minimize burden while providing clarity through ensuring that only necessary application and service relationships are left.

- **Key Metrics for Analysis:**
  - High applications importance
  - The number and regional distribution of those who use the base
  - SLA specifications: 99.9% uptime
  - Restoring data goals and daily backing needs (RPO/RTO)

## 4. Server Grouping and Migration Waves 
- **Logical Server Groupings:**
 - **Frontend:** NGINX hosts 
 - **Backend:** Node.js API hosts 
 - **Load balancer & Network services:** HAProxy and DNS settings
 - **Backup:** Linux-based backup infrastructure

- **Prioritization and Grouping:**
   - **Wave 1** involves the database and cache (the core data layer); 
   - **Wave 2** includes of the backend servers (API layer); 
   - **Wave 3** includes of the front end workers (web app interface); 
   - **Wave 4** includes of the load analyzer and DNS solutions.

  - **Precautions:**
   - Keep firewall rules consistent.
   - Verify that load balancer configurations have been correct.
   - Make plans for DNS transmission and any required IP modifications.

## 5. Migration Plan Documentation
 - **Step-by-Step Migration:**
  1. Set up Azure Cache for Memcache and Azure SQL Database for PostgreSQL; duplicate and check current data.
  2. Use Azure Management Disks (Standard SSD) to deploy front (NGINX) and backbone (Node.js) Azure virtual machines.
  3. To duplicate HAProxy functionality, set up Microsoft Load Balancer.
  4. To enable controlled recovery, move your backup service to Azure Backup.
  5. Modify DNS records to redirect to the updated IP addresses of the Azure load balancer.
  6. Verify the backup reconstruction, safety, efficiency, and connectivity tests.
  7. After authorization from stakeholders and satisfactory validation, remove the systems that are on premises.

- **Role of Application Owners:**
  - To ensure preparedness, run pre-migration verification tests.
  - Verify user satisfaction, efficiency, and usability by conducting post-migration verification.
