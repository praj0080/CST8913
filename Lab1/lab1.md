Migration plan for Lhoist's Iot adoption of azure defender.

Q-1: What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?
Ans:- There are many primary motivators for Lhoist's which are improved security which can reducing the possibility of malware attacks, pratical efficacy that can helps into system oprations and improve monitoring of network , IT connectivity helps to bussiness objectives, scalability which can help into deployment easier over the worldwide,cost reductions, Advanced future technology like microsoft technology office 365 and power BI for regualations and reports.

Q-2:What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?
Ans: Here some questions to get better idea of the company infrastructures.
-Which network topologies are currently in use for OT and IT?
-Are there any of the outdated equipment or systems that need particular attention?
-Which business processes are in use right now?
-Is asset tracking necessary, or are all OT devices currently documented?
-Are workloads or services in the cloud already in place?
-How fast is the company's network and how connected are the plants?
-Are cloud-based solutions recognized to IT and OT stakeholders?
-Are there rules unique to the sector that need to be adhered to?
-How are controlling access along with data governance already handled?

Q-3: Produce a RACI matrix for the migration stakeholders
Ans:- 
| Task                          | Responsible            | Accountable      | Consulted                       | Informed          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| Project Planning              | CISO (Cl√©ment Herssens)| VP of Operations | Plant Managers, Automation Team| Board Members     |
| Asset Discovery               | Team automation        | IT Security Team | OT Network Engineers            | Plant Managers    |
| Pilot installtion              | IT Security Team       | CISO             | MSSP, Automation Experts        | Operations Staff  |
| Threat Detection and Mitigation | IT Security Team      | MSSP             | Automation Experts              | Plant Staff       |
| Starting Rollout                | IT Security Team       | CISO             | VP of Operations, MSSP          | All Plants        |
| Connectivity and Optimization | MSSP             | IT Security Team | Automation Experts              | VP of Operations  |


Q-4: Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company.
Ans:- I will go for hybrid migration method which can best for the Lhosit.
-Pilot Installation: Start with a limited number of locations (five pilot sites, for example). Validate the capacity of Azure Defender for IoT and how it works with the current infrastructures (such as AlienVault SIEM).
-Starting Rollout: To ensure the least amount of operational disturbance, gradually extend activation to more plants in a prearranged order.
-Agentless Installation: To prevent performance issues on OT devices, utilize Azure Defender for IoT's agentless functionality.
-Connectivity and Optimizing: For smooth surveillance, interconnect into MSSP and SOC systems. Adjust parameters to cut down on noise and guarantee flexible alarms.

Q-5: Produce a high level schedule for the migration process
Ans:- 
| Phase                    | Duration     | Key Activities                                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planning and Assessment  | 2 Months     | Stakeholder alignment, infrastructure evaluation, and the RFP method |
| Pilot installtion        | 4 Months     | Install at five locations, then check interaction and efficiency.    |
| Global Rollout Planning  | 1 Month      | Create installation schedules tailored to each site.                 |
| Global Rollout           | 1 year       |installation in segments across 80 plants                             |
| Ongoing Optimization     | Continuous   | Adjusting, maintaining, offering operational assistance              |


Q-6: What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?
Ans: A number of important factors impacted Lhoist's choice of using Azure Defender for IoT. Strong security efficacy and the capacity to detect and address threats in operational technology (OT) systems are essential parts of the solution. Agentless tracking guarantees less disruption to current operational technologies, making adoption simple. A further crucial factor is adaptability to allow for smooth worldwide deployment across numerous plants, along with connectivity with various OT protocols and older systems. Maintaining operational consistency includes integration with current tools, such AlienVault SIEM. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis must also demonstrate an excellent value on investment (ROI), which is fueled by increased security posture, decreased interruptions and improved performance.
